 * Given a set of integers, partition those integers into two parts where the difference between the two parts is minimum.
 * This problem is known as balanced partition problem. For example, array A = {1,7,4,11},
 * two subsets can be: {1,11} and {7,4}, two have a difference of 1, which is the minimum difference we can get
 * by splitting this array.
